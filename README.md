This Fortran 95 code contains routines that simulate Saturn's rings and the orbits of 8 of Saturn's moons in order to generate structure (e.g. the Cassini division). Completed for a graduate-level class project in 2017. 

Runs for 500 Saturn rotations, or ~50,000 hours. Number of ring particles = 20,000. Assumes that each moon has gravitational influence on the other moons and on each ring particle, but does not assume that the ring particles themselves interact with each other gravitationally. Assumes Saturn is a point mass within the ring particles.
